# Estimating COVID-19 case ascertainment in Australia from survey and reason for testing data

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This repo contains experimental methods to infer the time-varying fraction of Australian COVID-19 cases that receive a positive test result. Previous work attempted to estimate this from daily deaths and an assumption about the infeciton fatiility rate. Tjis repository aims to make inferences based on survey data relating to test seeking behaviour, and recorded reasons for test seeking.

The methods are currently in early development and undergoing testinig with synthetic data.
