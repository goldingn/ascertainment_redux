# Estimating COVID-19 case ascertainment in Australia from survey and reason for testing data

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This repo contains experimental methods to infer the time-varying
fraction of Australian COVID-19 cases that receive a positive test
result. [Previous
work](https://github.com/goldingn/australia_covid_ascertainment) from
way back at the start of the pandemic attempted to estimate this from
daily deaths and an assumption about the infection fatality rate. This
repository aims to make inferences based on survey data relating to test
seeking behaviour, and recorded reasons for test seeking.

The methods are currently in early development and undergoing testing
with synthetic data.
